      Hi, my name is Jon Koller. <br>
      My primary role is a games and web developer with my focus shifting towards augmented and virtual reality. 
      I'm passionate about both contemporary, digital media and traditional media as means of communicating complex ideas. Where language fails us, subjective experience can carry our demands to connect.<br>
      I carry this mindfulness into the work that I do. I'm dedicated to the craft of producing purposeful content, sharing knowledge, and most of all, telling stories.  I believe that burgeoning media such as augmented and virtual reality will transform our ability to treat the mentally ill as well as educate and empower students of psychology with simulated experiential knowledge. As a whole, VR and AR have the potential to expand our culture's fascination with the mind and the vitality of compassion in a world where modern and post-modern ideologies appear to clash in step with regularity. <br>
      I owe my passion to the Jesuits who trained me at Fordham University. At that institution, I learned the importance of mindfully situating one's professional and cultural identity in a way that confronts one's inclinations towards nihilism. <br>
      For six years I applied my college education in psychology and ethnography by working in mental health, sports and fitness, education, and various levels of retail work spaces. Through my capacity as a coach, counselor, and efficiency expert, I learned a lot about American society and, most importantly, where it is displaced from its historical identity. The United States is an amalgam of all other societies, after all; this is the truth of globalization as it continues to pique under the growing weight of our global status. <br>
      <br>
      <p>Meritocracy</p>
      Technology is how we can enable the most disaffected to catch up. Specifically, I mean, through the dispersion of this immense gift programmers like me possess: the knowledge demanded of spurios economic sectors. This is obviously where education comes in. I take pride in my work as an educator because it's in tech that a person  without a degree can self-actualize in the Maslowian sense. That's a beautiful thing.
