</p> Introductory pledge to Jung's gatherings in 1930: 
<p>"We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights nad oppresses them, the people have the further right to alter it or to abolish it. The British Government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of hte masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually. We believe that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraj or complete independence.</p>
