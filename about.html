            <br>Video games are still the height of user immersion. If you play any of the current iterations of the top franchises available today, if they're not completely adverse to fantasy, sports, or violence,
              (or video games as a whole, for that matter), your awareness can be utterly encapsulated into vast and highly detailed virtual landscapes.
              <br> Topics that elude the grasp of the auteur are theoretically at the disposal of creators of new media, but <b> both games and film </b> are the key to creating impactful work.
