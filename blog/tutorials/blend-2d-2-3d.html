I'm not chummy enough to claim credit for however decent this tutorial may turn out. I do, however, deserve credit for researching this topic so thoroughly.

1. save a file
2. import into Inkscape 
3. (select) image and then use path > trace bitmap, check Remove Background
4. save as .svg and import it into blender
5. extrude along z until its depth looks ok (example is using a car)

 > * > cites a few free online tools to use for conversion to .svg at around 35 seconds 

<b><em> 
1st: convert low-res jpg to .svg
	</em> </b><br>
1. if we're using a photo with a low resolution, we need to convert it to .svg in Inkscape - import and then drag photo to the side 
2. when tracing bitmap, choose colors radio button, uncheck smooth and stack scans, and check remove background. set scans to 3 
3. press ctrl to drag corner to resize image to fit width of canvas 
4. save as .svg file

<b><em> 
2nd: Blender... assuming we're modeling a Blender logo from 2D to 3D
	</em> </b><br>
1. import .svg and pull image into view
2. the different colors are different curves so they need to be joined: ctrl + j when both are selected
3. alt + c and then Mesh from Curve/Meta/Surf/Text
4. RELOCATE TO CENTER: drag so image is in the center and then press ctrl + a and then location 
5. R X 90 to rotate 90 degrees along x-axis
6. (1 and 5 to enter frontal orthographic view) in edit mode:  -a to select all faces/edges
-3 to move to side
-e to extrude a bit (or however much is needed)
-a or a-a to deselect everything 
7. move mouse to center and press L to select linked vertices
8. go to materials and press + icon
9. go to drop down w/ circular icon on left edge of panel to select the blue material (WHICH IS IMPORTED DURING THE IMPORT OF THE .SVG). Press Assign to apply this material.

can export from inkscape by merely selecting on the image produced by the Bitmap tracing.

<b><em>Using Goomba</em></b>
*a. Assumes we know how to put a background image down
1. extrudes a cube over image
2. bevels on four corners from the top to round out the sides
3.
