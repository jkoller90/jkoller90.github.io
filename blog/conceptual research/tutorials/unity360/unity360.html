"[Ideal patch is 5.6.1p2]" <br>
1. Flip normals in Ico Sphere in Blender (add Ico, then increase subdivisions to 6 and generate UV's in bottom left menu)<br>
2. Press W and then Flip Normals<br>
3. Bring sphere into Unity and change ((all scale dimensions to 5 in 5.6.1p2)) <br>
4. Put camera to 0. <br>
5. Go to sphere, add component: Video Player <br> 
At this point, there's no audio and the material is wrong because it is influenced by the light around it <br>
<br>
6. Add component to sphere called Audio Source and then under Video Player, select audio source with its own name 
(e.g. ico sphere normals inside was the name of my 3d object so that's the name of the audio source in my project) <br>
7. Right click, create, material: <br>
8. Set shader to unlit texture <br>
