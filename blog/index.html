          <h2> 10/11/17: A cool article on meditation! </h2>
          "'Why don’t you just meditate for 10 minutes everyday?” my mom often said when I was a teenager. “It will change your life.'
          Of course I didn’t. Like all children who rebel against repeated entreaties from parents, I took a lifelong aversion to meditation that still hasn’t changed. It also has to do with disposition. Running works for some; meditating works for others. Some runners say that they are in a zen state when they are pounding the pavement. All these methods lead to improved physical and mental health. I just haven’t found one that I can stick with."
