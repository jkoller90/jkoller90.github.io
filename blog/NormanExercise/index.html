          <h2> 10/29/17: An Examination of Don Norman's <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> Through Camcording Equipment </h2>
					<h3><em>1.Important Terms: Affordances, Signfiers, and Mappings</em></h3>
					<p>The concept of the affordance is a central feature of <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i>. To the author, Don Norman, it refers to a relationship between an object and a person, presumably the user. Within this relationship it is determined what the object is used for. For example, a table can afford that the user place a computer monitor on it or that they may sit on it. Norman draws a strict contrast between this relational concept and what most people naively refer to as its properties: "Whether an affordance exists depends [on] the properties of both the object and the agent."</p>
					
					<p> For example, take the property for a camera that can take photos: it alone can take them, but in the hands of a professional photographer, the camera and the user afford the potential for artistic or very clarified photography. Alternatively, an animator may use the same device and produce stop-motion sequences, thus producing the affordance for making a movie with the same camera. On the base level, however, many of us can only afford to produce impish selfies and blurry photos of our dogs in our failed attempts at capturing the moment when Spike caught the tennis ball.</p>
					
					<p>For this essay, it's important to also consider another of Norman's design concepts: the signifier. This is the property of the object which indicates to the user that certain features are available to them. They communicate how these affordances should be initiated with the given setup. A great example of this is the affordance to sculpt in two free 3D modeling programs: Sculptris and Blender. Sculptris, as the name probably suggets, is a tool offered by Pixologic which was designed with sculpting in mind: as soon as you open the program, a big, spherical 3D mesh is in front of you and on the top left of the screen are obvious cues (buttons) which correspond to different functions that the cursor can have upon clicking and dragging on the mesh. If you're unfamiliar with the program, the program will give you small prompts right over your mouse cursor when you hover over them (e.g. "Flatten", "Smooth", and "Pinch"). See below:</p>

					<p>Blender, on the other hand, is built as a professional-grade modeling program, which, generaly speaking, means its the amount of properties are great, but the affordances by the user are largely dependent on their familiarity of complex signifying threads. Sculpting is a perfect example of this. Given the format of the default project layout, it isn't entirely obvious how to use this feature. Consider the following image: </p>

					<p>
					On first glance, sculpting seems a wistful concept to the Blender novice, though it's a truly central feature of many 3D modelers' workflows. In order to do this, the user must press the Object Mode button on the second-to-bottom panel and select Sculpt Mode on the menu that pops up above it. From that point, the user can now begin sculpting in the identical mechanical fashion as in Sculptris (i.e. clicking and dragging) but with a less abstracted feature set such as "Flattening, smoothing, and pinching"; these must be manually recreated through various adjustments in the left panel. This menu, however, won't appear unless the user knows to press the hotkey "t" to reveal these tools:

					<p>The difference between these systems helps us to clearly distinguish between the mappings of two comparable systems. For Norman, a mapping is a layout of control schemes, which determine how obvious affordances are signified. In Blender, the mapping is not at all clarified for sculpting, whereas Sculptris makes the system's mapping very obvious and clear to the user.</p>
					
					<h3><em>2. Comparing Camcorders</em></h3>
					
					<p>I'm interested in comparing two camcorders that are, or were, priced similarly. These will be the Flip Video HD and the Rainbowday Vlogging Camcorder.</p>
