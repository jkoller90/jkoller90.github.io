 began Fall 2017 with an idea to be a gameplay programmer.

What I found as I peered into what turned into a very isolated personal abyss was the excellent work by Jonathan Blow. 
Blow is an independent game developer who designed and programmed Braid and The Witness.
What first drew me to his work was his outspoken commitment to what I would term a very humanistic awareness of human-computer interaction which hinged on abrasive to the ears of more commercially-oriented developers. Some of his targets included free-to-play mobile Skinner boxes as well as perhaps more benign escapist titles.

Secondly, I am very intrigued by his approach to programming the immensely complex state machines that games are. 
By extension, I'm intrigued by his programming language, Jai.

Third, I propose to conclude that there are worthwhile parallels between Jai and Ludwig Wittgenstein's <logic> which inverts an object-oriented perspective of the world itself.
>By extension, Wittgenstein takes aim at set theory.
