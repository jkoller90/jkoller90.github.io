Practical extractions:

Acton 2014:
1. Solve for the most common case first


Llopis 2009:
1. Break down each object into different components, 
2. Group the components of the same type together in memory regardless of what object they came from


Caruth 2014: 
Just use vectors instead of other standard queues and stacks.
Use open addresses for key-value pairs instead of buckets for maps.
