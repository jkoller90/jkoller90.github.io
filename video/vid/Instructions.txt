I. Command-line 
react-native init vid
npm install react-native --save

II. In x-code
1. Right-click on Libraries and click Add Files to "vid"... -> add RCTVideo.xcodeproj .This should be under node_modules/react-native-video.
2. Add video framework to build process: Under Build Phases (click on vid on left and then in viewport click on Build Phases), under Link Binary With Libraries, click "+" and add libRCTVideo.a 
3. It may not require this step but the project directory may be missing the mp4 on the left-hand side. If they're not there, then import the mp4 by right-clicking and Add Files to "vid"... again. 
4. Add a copy of the mp4 in vid and then video/ then video/vid/ 


Run/compile and voila, hopefully.
